## Image Classification: Classifying Images from the CIFAR-10 dataset

<p>The aim of this project is to build a convulational neural network using Tensorflow which classifies images from the CIFAR-10 dataset. The dataset consists of airplanes, dogs, cats, and other objects.</p>

<p>To summarize, the images in the dataset are preprocessed, and then a convolutional neural network is trained on all the samples. The images need to be normalized and the labels need to be one-hot encoded. A convolutional, max pooling, dropout, and fully connected layers are built and then at the end, neural network's predictions on the sample images are examined. </p>
